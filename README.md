Moodle peer activity module
====================================
Peer is a activity module for Moodle which allows teachers to create a peer review activity. Students can submit their work and review the submissions of other students.


Motivation
----------
Whereas the Workshop activity only allows to make reviews or submissions at a specific phase the peer plugin allows to submit and review at the same time. This plugin is useful if you want students to learn in a more collaborative environment. They can edit their submission based on received reviews. So in the end all students have the chance to have a "perfect" solution for the given task. This plugin mainly targets classes where projects or group work is commonly used. To achieve a more open classroom the peer plugin posts the submissions by student groups as blog post and add written reviews as comments to the associated blog post. So even students or teachers who are not enrolled in the course can see whats happening in the course.


Usage
-----

**Note**: It only makes sense to use this plugin if the group mode of the course is set to 'Visible Groups'.

1. Add the module instance into the course.
2. Write an introduction / description.
3. Add Review Criterias for yes / no answers
4. Add due dates for Groupings
5. Choose Activity Completion if activated.
5. Save the settings.
